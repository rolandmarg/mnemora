# CLAUDE.md

Claude-specific notes for this repository.

## Canonical Guidance

- The canonical, model-agnostic agent policy is in `AGENTS.md`.
- Follow `AGENTS.md` first for project behavior, workflow, and quality gates.

## Claude Runtime Note

- If Claude tooling offers Claude-only skills or shortcuts, they may be used as implementation details, but they must not override `AGENTS.md` policy.
