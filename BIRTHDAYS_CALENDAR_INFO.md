# About Google's Birthdays Calendar

## Important: Birthdays Calendar Cannot Be Shared

Google's **Birthdays** calendar is a special system calendar that:
- ✅ **Cannot be shared directly** with service accounts
- ✅ **Cannot be accessed via API** separately
- ✅ **Automatically syncs** birthday events to your main calendar when enabled

## How It Works

When you enable the Birthdays calendar in Google Calendar:

1. **Birthdays appear in your main calendar** - Contact birthdays are automatically added as events in your primary calendar
2. **They're recurring yearly events** - Each birthday repeats every year on the same date
3. **Event title is usually just the contact's name** - Or "Contact's Birthday" format

## Solution: Use Your Main Calendar

Since the Birthdays calendar syncs to your main calendar, you can:

1. **Enable Birthdays calendar** in Google Calendar settings
2. **Share your main calendar** with the service account (which you've done ✅)
3. **The bot will find birthdays** in your main calendar automatically

## How to Enable Birthdays Calendar

1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
2. Click gear icon ⚙️ → **Settings**
3. In left sidebar, find **"Add calendar"**
4. Click **"Browse calendars of interest"**
5. Find **"Birthdays"** and toggle it **ON**
6. The Birthdays calendar will now appear in your calendar list
7. Birthday events will automatically appear in your main calendar

## Verifying Birthdays Are Synced

After enabling the Birthdays calendar:

1. Check your main calendar - you should see birthday events
2. They'll be recurring yearly events
3. The title will be the contact's name or "Contact's Birthday"

## The Bot Will Find Them

Once birthdays are synced to your main calendar (which is shared with the service account), the bot will:
- ✅ Find all birthday events automatically
- ✅ Detect them as recurring yearly events
- ✅ Extract contact names from event titles
- ✅ Send birthday wishes on the correct dates

No need to share the Birthdays calendar separately - it's not possible anyway!
