# AI-Assisted Development Disclaimer

## Overview

This project, **Mnemora**, was developed primarily with the assistance of AI models (specifically Claude via Cursor AI). This document provides transparency about the development process and what this means for users and contributors.

## Development Process

### AI Assistance

- **Primary Development Tool**: Most of the codebase was written, refactored, and structured with the assistance of AI models
- **Architecture Decisions**: System architecture, design patterns, and code organization were developed in collaboration with AI
- **Code Generation**: Significant portions of the code were generated by AI based on requirements and specifications
- **Documentation**: Much of the documentation, including README, architecture docs, and code comments, was AI-generated

### Human Oversight

- **Requirements**: Project requirements and specifications were provided by the human developer
- **Review**: Code has been reviewed and tested by the human developer
- **Decisions**: Final architectural and implementation decisions were made by the human developer
- **Testing**: Manual testing and validation were performed by the human developer

## What This Means

### For Users

- **Functionality**: The code has been tested and should work as described
- **Quality**: Code follows standard TypeScript/Node.js best practices
- **Support**: Issues and bugs may be addressed with AI assistance
- **Transparency**: You're aware that the codebase was AI-assisted

### For Contributors

- **Code Style**: The codebase follows AI-generated patterns and conventions
- **Architecture**: The architecture was designed with AI assistance
- **Documentation**: Documentation was primarily AI-generated
- **Contributions**: Feel free to contribute, but be aware of the AI-assisted nature

## Code Quality

### Strengths

- ✅ Follows TypeScript best practices
- ✅ Uses established design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Template Method, Adapter)
- ✅ Well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Type-safe with strict TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Structured logging

### Considerations

- Code patterns may reflect AI-generated conventions
- Some implementations may be more verbose than hand-written code
- Architecture may include AI-suggested patterns that could be simplified
- Documentation style is consistent but AI-generated

## AI Tools Used

- **Cursor AI** (Claude): Primary development assistant
- **Code Generation**: Used for generating boilerplate, implementing patterns, and refactoring
- **Documentation**: Used for generating README, architecture docs, and code comments
- **Debugging**: Used for identifying and fixing issues

## License

This disclaimer does not affect the project license (ISC). The code is provided as-is, with the understanding that it was developed with AI assistance.

## Questions or Concerns

If you have questions about the AI-assisted development process or concerns about code quality, please:

1. Review the codebase yourself
2. Test the functionality
3. Open an issue if you find problems
4. Contribute improvements if you'd like

## Transparency Statement

We believe in transparency about development processes. This disclaimer is provided to ensure users and contributors understand how this project was created and can make informed decisions about using or contributing to it.
