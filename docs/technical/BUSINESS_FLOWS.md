## Normal Execution Flow

### Trigger
- **Scheduled**: EventBridge rule triggers Lambda daily at 9:00 AM Los Angeles time
- **Manual**: Lambda function invoked manually via AWS Console or CLI

### Flow Steps

1. **Lambda Handler Entry** (`src/lambda/handler.ts`)
   - Initialize correlation ID from request ID
   - Log execution start
   - Track execution start metric
   - Call `runBirthdayCheck()`

2. **Check for Missed Monthly Digests** (`src/services/birthday-orchestrator.service.ts::checkAndSendMissedDays()`)
   - Read last run date from S3 (or local file)
   - Calculate missed dates since last run
   - Filter for missed 1st-of-month dates only
   - If missed 1st-of-month dates exist:
     - For each missed 1st-of-month date:
       - Fetch entire month's birthdays for that date
       - Generate monthly digest message
       - Send monthly digest via WhatsApp
       - Wait 1 second between sends
     - Log missed monthly digest recovery
   - If no missed 1st-of-month dates: Continue to main flow
   - Note: Only monthly digests are recovered, not individual birthday messages

3. **Fetch Today's Birthdays** (`src/services/birthday.service.ts::getTodaysBirthdaysWithMonthlyDigest()`)
   - Check if today is first day of month
   - If first of month:
     - Fetch entire month's birthdays (optimized single API call)
     - Filter for today's birthdays from month data
     - Return both `todaysBirthdays` and `monthlyBirthdays`
   - If not first of month:
     - Fetch only today's birthdays
     - Return `todaysBirthdays` only
   - Track API calls and operation duration

4. **Send Monthly Digest** (if first of month)
   - Format monthly digest: `🎂 Date: Name 🎉, Name 🎭`
   - Initialize WhatsApp channel
   - Resolve group identifier (name or ID) using `resolveGroupId()`
   - Send digest to WhatsApp group via `recipients` array
   - Track monthly digest sent metric
   - If send fails on 1st: CRITICAL alert
   - If send fails on other days: WARNING alert

5. **Send Today's Birthday Messages** (if birthdays exist)
   - Format personal messages: `🎂 🎉 Name` (one per person)
   - Note: On 1st of month, both monthly digest AND today's birthday messages are sent
   - For each birthday:
     - Send individual message to WhatsApp group
     - Wait 1 second between messages (rate limiting)
     - Track success/failure
   - If no birthdays: Log "No birthdays today"

6. **Update Last Run Date**
   - Write current date to S3 (or local file)
   - Record execution in monitoring system
   - Track successful execution metric

7. **Cleanup**
   - Flush CloudWatch metrics
   - Destroy WhatsApp client (preserves session)
   - Return success response

### Success Criteria
- Lambda returns 200 status code
- Last run date updated in S3
- Monitoring record shows `executed: true`
- CloudWatch metric `execution.completed` = 1

---

## Missed Monthly Digest Recovery Flow

### Trigger
- Detected during normal execution flow
- Calculated by comparing last run date to today
- Only recovers missed 1st-of-month dates (for monthly digests)

### Flow Steps

1. **Detection** (`src/services/last-run-tracker.service.ts::getMissedDates()`)
   - Read last run date from S3
   - Calculate all dates between last run and today (exclusive)
   - Return array of missed dates

2. **Recovery Decision**
   - Filter missed dates to only include 1st-of-month dates
   - If missed 1st-of-month dates exist:
     - Take only the **latest** (most recent) missed 1st-of-month date
     - This prevents spamming multiple monthly digests
   - If no missed 1st-of-month dates: Skip recovery
   - Note: Individual birthday messages are NOT recovered, only monthly digests

3. **Fetch Missed Month's Birthdays**
   - Query Google Calendar for entire month's birthdays for the latest missed 1st-of-month
   - Generate monthly digest message
   - Send monthly digest via WhatsApp
   - If no birthdays found: Log and skip

4. **Error Handling**
   - If WhatsApp unavailable: Log and skip (non-critical)
   - If calendar API fails: Log error and send alert
   - Recovery failures don't block main execution
   - Each failed recovery sends `missed-days-recovery-failed` alert

### Success Criteria
- Latest missed 1st-of-month monthly digest sent (if any)
- Main execution continues normally
- Missed days metric tracked

---

## Monthly Digest Flow

### Trigger
- Automatically detected on first day of month
- Part of normal execution flow

### Flow Steps

1. **Date Check** (`src/utils/date-helpers.ts::isFirstDayOfMonth()`)
   - Check if today is the 1st of the month
   - If yes: Generate monthly digest
   - If no: Skip digest generation

2. **Fetch Month's Birthdays**
   - Fetch all birthdays for current month (single API call)
   - Group by date
   - Sort dates chronologically

3. **Format Monthly Digest**
   - For each date with birthdays:
     - Format: `🎂 Nov 8: Martin 🎭, Sarah 🎉`
     - Birthday cake emoji always first
     - Random emoji at end of each name
     - Dates padded for alignment
   - Join with newlines

4. **Send Digest**
   - Initialize WhatsApp channel
   - Resolve group identifier using `resolveGroupId()` (accepts name or ID)
   - Send formatted digest to group via `recipients` array
   - Track `monthly_digest.sent` metric
   - Record in monitoring: `monthlyDigestSent: true`

5. **Error Handling**
   - If WhatsApp unavailable: Log warning
   - If send fails: Log error (non-critical for main flow)
   - On 1st of month: Send CRITICAL alert if digest fails

### Success Criteria
- Monthly digest sent successfully
- Metric `monitoring.monthly_digest_sent` = 1
- Monitoring record shows `monthlyDigestSent: true`

---

## WhatsApp Authentication Flow

### Trigger
- First time execution (no session exists)
- Session expired (7+ days since last auth)
- Session file corrupted or missing

### Flow Steps

1. **Check Session** (`src/output-channel/implementations/whatsapp.channel.ts::initializeClient()`)
   - Check if session exists in S3 (Lambda) or local filesystem
   - If session exists: Try to use saved session
   - If no session: Require authentication

2. **Initialize Client**
   - Create WhatsApp Web.js client with LocalAuth
   - Configure Puppeteer (headless mode)
   - Set up event handlers

3. **QR Code Display**
   - Client emits `qr` event with QR code string
   - In Lambda: Log QR code to CloudWatch Logs (structured JSON)
   - In Local: Display QR code in terminal using `qrcode-terminal`
   - Track `whatsapp.auth.required` metric
   - Send WARNING alert: WhatsApp authentication required

4. **User Action Required**
   - User must scan QR code with WhatsApp mobile app
   - Steps:
     1. Open WhatsApp on phone
     2. Go to Settings → Linked Devices
     3. Tap "Link a Device"
     4. Scan QR code from CloudWatch Logs (Lambda) or terminal (local)

5. **Authentication**
   - Client emits `authenticated` event when QR scanned
   - Client emits `ready` event when fully connected
   - Session automatically saved to S3 (Lambda) or local filesystem
   - Record authentication timestamp in S3
   - Track `whatsapp.session.refreshed` metric

6. **Session Persistence**
   - Session stored in S3: `.wwebjs_auth/` directory
   - Next execution uses saved session (no QR code needed)
   - Session valid for ~7 days (WhatsApp Web limitation)

### Success Criteria
- Client state is `CONNECTED` or `OPENING`
- Session file exists in S3
- Authentication timestamp recorded
- No QR code required on subsequent runs

### Failure Scenarios
- **Initialization timeout** (3 minutes): Send WARNING alert
- **Authentication failure**: Send WARNING alert, log error
- **Session save failure**: Log warning (session may not persist)

## Success and Failure Paths

### Complete Success Path
1. Lambda triggered
2. Missed days checked (none or recovered)
3. Birthdays fetched successfully
4. Monthly digest sent (if applicable)
5. Today's birthday messages sent
6. Last run date updated
7. Metrics flushed
8. Lambda returns 200

### Partial Success Path (Non-Critical Failures)
1. Lambda triggered
2. Missed days checked (recovery failed, but logged)
3. Birthdays fetched successfully
4. Monthly digest generation succeeds
5. WhatsApp send fails (WARNING alert sent)
6. Last run date updated
7. Metrics flushed
8. Lambda returns 200 (execution "succeeded" despite WhatsApp failure)

### Complete Failure Path
1. Lambda triggered
2. Exception thrown (e.g., Calendar API auth failure)
3. Error caught in handler
4. CRITICAL alert sent
5. Failed execution recorded
6. Lambda returns 500

---

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Daily Health Check (via Monitoring Service)
- Check if execution happened today
- Check if monthly digest sent (if 1st of month)
- Emit health metrics
- Generate health status report

### Alert State Tracking
- Active alerts stored in S3: `alerts/active-alerts.json`
- Track: first occurrence, last occurrence, count, resolved status
- Used for daily summary generation
- Alert resolution when conditions clear

---

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Multiple Missed 1st-of-Month Dates
- **Behavior**: Only recover the latest (most recent) missed 1st-of-month date
- **Rationale**: Prevents spamming the group with multiple monthly digests
- **Alert**: None (expected behavior)

### Edge Case 2: No Birthdays in Missed Month
- **Behavior**: Log and skip recovery (no digest sent)
- **Rationale**: Nothing to send for that month
- **Alert**: None

### Edge Case 3: Monthly Digest on Day with Birthdays (1st of Month)
- **Behavior**: Send both monthly digest AND today's birthday messages
- **Rationale**: Both are relevant on 1st of month
- **Note**: People with birthdays on the 1st appear in both the digest and get individual messages
- **Alert**: None (normal behavior)

### Edge Case 4: WhatsApp Unavailable During Monthly Digest Recovery
- **Behavior**: Skip recovery, continue main execution
- **Rationale**: Recovery is best-effort, main execution is priority
- **Alert**: WARNING `missed-days-recovery-failed` if recovery was needed

### Edge Case 5: Execution Runs Twice Same Day
- **Behavior**: Second execution sees today as "last run", no missed days
- **Rationale**: Last run date is today, so no recovery needed
- **Alert**: None (normal behavior)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Execution Duration Targets
- Normal execution: <2 minutes
- With monthly digest: <3 minutes
- With missed monthly digest recovery: <4 minutes (depends on number of missed 1st-of-months)
- Maximum timeout: 15 minutes (Lambda limit)

### API Call Optimization
- Monthly digest: Single API call for entire month (not 30 separate calls)
- Birthday fetch: Single API call per date range
- WhatsApp: Sequential sends with 1-second delays

### Resource Usage
- Lambda memory: 512 MB (sufficient for WhatsApp Web.js)
- Lambda timeout: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
- S3 storage: Minimal (session files, execution records)

---

## Recovery Procedures

### Manual Recovery Steps

1. **Execution Failed**
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for error details
   - Verify correlation ID for tracing
   - Fix underlying issue
   - Manually trigger Lambda if needed

2. **WhatsApp Auth Required**
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for QR code
   - Generate QR code image from log
   - Scan with WhatsApp mobile app
   - Verify session saved in S3

3. **Monthly Digest Missed**
   - Check if it's still 1st of month
   - Manually trigger Lambda
   - Or use manual-send script locally

4. **API Quota Exceeded**
   - Wait for quota reset (daily)
   - Optimize API calls
   - Request quota increase from Google

5. **Group Not Found**
   - Verify exact group name (case-sensitive) or correct group ID
   - Ensure bot's WhatsApp account is in group
   - Check group name/ID in WhatsApp settings
   - Verify `WHATSAPP_GROUP_ID` config if using default
